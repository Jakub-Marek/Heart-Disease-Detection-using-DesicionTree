# Heart-Disease-Detection-using-DesicionTree
Heart Disease/Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the main causes of death around the world. In the United States CVD was found to be the leading cause of death among men and women across all ethnic groups. This is a huge problem, new methods for not just treating the illness but also for quick and early detection need to be developed to reduce the numbers of CVD deaths per year. In this paper, a classification model will be used to differentiate from a group of patients who have and do not have CVD. The classification model that will be used is called Decision Tree Classification, which is a model that focuses on nodes and splits to separate out the parameters into checkpoints that it runs the data through. Using this classifier individuals can run large amounts of data rather quickly based on the compact nature of Decision Trees. Using this method, doctors or patients can input their metrics that are required for the dataset parameters and this project will output with around 90% accuracy whether an individual has heart disease. This would be a valuable tool that can be used in the medical setting which can help doctors very quickly and efficiently reach conclusions about their patients regarding cardiovascular health.
